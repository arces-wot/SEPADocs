	<!-- ABSTRACT -->
	<section id="abstract">
		This document describes the <b>SPARQL Event Processing
			Architecture (SEPA)</b>. The SEPA consists of the following components:
		the <i>SPARQL Secure Event (SE) Protocol Service</i> (also known as
		SEPA Broker), the <a
			href="http://mml.arces.unibo.it/TR/sparql11-se-protocol.html">SPARQL
			1.1 Secure Event (SE) Protocol</a> and the <a
			href="http://mml.arces.unibo.it/TR/sparql11-subscribe.html">SPARQL
			1.1 Subscribe Language</a>. The SEPA aims supporting the development of distributed, Web based and
		context aware applications, in particular with reference to <b>dynamic
			contexts</b> where detecting and reacting to events is critical. In such
		contexts, the use of SPARQL queries [[sparql11-query]] MAY be
		inefficient and MAY not guarantee to detect all the events because of
		their asynchronous nature. Furthermore, the publish-subscribe
		mechanism offered by the SEPA MAY support <b>semantic driven
			coordination and discovery</b>. Eventually, the SEPA is built around a <b>security
			layer</b> (e.g.,TLS [[!RFC5246]]) and it allows <b>clients
			authentication</b> by means of JSON Web Tokens [[!RFC7519]].

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
			The proposed architecture implementing a <b>content based
				publish-subscribe</b> mechanism over SPARQL is named SEPA (SPARQL Event
			Processing Architecture). The core component of SEPA is the SPARQL SE
			Protocol Service (also know as <b>SEPA Broker</b>). The SEPA Broker
			implements the subscription mechanisms and algorithms. The SEPA is
			framed within W3C Recommendations as shown in the following figure.

			A SPARQL SE Protocol Service MUST implement the <a

				1.1 Secure Event (SE) Protocol</a> that is proposed as an extension of
			the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol [[sparql11-protocol]] and, as shown in Fig.
			1, it wraps the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol [[sparql11-protocol]] to support
			the subscribe primitives (i.e., <b>subscribe</b>, <b>unsubscribe</b>).
			The SPARQL 1.1 SE protocol is built around a <b>security layer</b>
			(e.g.,TLS [[!RFC5246]]) and it allows <b>client authentication</b> by
			means of JSON Web Tokens [[!RFC7519]]. The SEPA Broker is built on
			top of a SPARQL Protocol Service [[sparql11-protocol]].

		<h2>The content-based subscription mechanism</h2>
		<p>
			The SEPA Broker implements a <b>content based publish-subscribe</b>
			mechanism where the content of events is expressed using the <i>SPARQL
				1.1 Query Language</i> [[sparql11-query]]. A SPARQL subscription acts as
			a persistent query: on every <i>SPARQL update</i>
			[[sparql11-update]], the query is evaluated and the results returned.
			Instead of returning all the results, the SEPA Broker returns only
			changes in the results (i.e., <i>added and removed bindings
				results</i>). This allows saving network traffic (e.g., a relevant
			aspect in low rates network typical of Web of Things systems) and
			reducing processing cost on the client side (i.e., no need to compare
			previous results with the current ones to understand what is
			changed).
		<p>Considering the previous results as the query results before
			the update and the current results as the query results after the
			update, the content of a notification includes the added and removed
			results as shown in the following figure:</p>
		</p>

		<img src="images/addedremoved.jpg"
			title="The content of notifications: added and removed results"><br>
		<p>Fig. 2 - The content of notifications: added and removed
			results</p>

		<p>The publish-subscribe mechanism implemented by a SEPA Broker
			acts as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On receiving a <b>subscribe</b> request:
				<ol>
					<li>It registers the subscription and returns to the
						subscriber the subscription URI (named <i>SPUID</i>, Subscription
						Processing Unit ID)
					</li>
					<li>It performs the <i>SPARQL 1.1 Query</i> [[sparql11-query]]
						specified in the subscription request and notifies the subscriber
						of the results (if any)
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>On receiving an <b>update</b> request:
				<ol>
					<li>It checks all the active subscriptions for results to be
						notified (added, removed or both)</li>
					<li>It sends notifications (if any) to the subscribers</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
