	<!-- ABSTRACT -->
	<section id="abstract">
		This document describes the <b>SPARQL Event Processing
			Architecture (SEPA)</b>. The SEPA consists of the following components:
		the SPARQL Secure Event Protocol (SSEP) Service, the SPARQL 1.1 Secure
		Event (SE) Protocol and the SPARQL Subscription Language. The SEPA is
		intended to be used in <b>dynamic contexts</b> where detecting events
		is critical. In such contexts, the use of SPARQL queries MAY be
		inefficient and MAY not guarantee to detect all the events because of
		their asynchronous nature. Moreover, the SEPA is built around a <b>security
			layer</b> (e.g.,TLS [[!RFC5246]]) in order to be applied in all the
		contexts where the security MUST be supported (e.g., the <b>Web of
			Things</b>).

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
			The proposed architecture implementing a <b>content based
				publish-subscribe</b> mechanism over SPARQL is named SEPA (SPARQL Event
			Processing Architecture). The core component of SEPA is the SPARQL SE
			Protocol Service (also know as <b>SEPA Engine</b>). The SEPA Engine
			implements the subscription mechanisms and algorithms. The SEPA is
			framed within W3C Recommendations as shown in the following figure.

		<p>
			A SPARQL SE Protocol Service MUST implement the SPARQL 1.1 SE
			Protocol [[sparql-11-se-protocol]]. The SPARQL 1.1 SE Protocol
			[[sparql-11-se-protocol]] is proposed as an extension of the SPARQL
			1.1 Protocol [[sparql11-protocol]] and, as shown in Fig. 1, it wraps
			the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol [[sparql11-protocol]] to support the
			subscription primitives (i.e., <b>subscribe</b>, <b>unsubscribe</b>).
			The SPARQL 1.1 SE protocol is built around a <b>security layer</b>
			(e.g.,TLS [[!RFC5246]]) and it allows <b>client authentication</b> by
			means of JSON Web Tokens [[!RFC7519]]. The SEPA Engine is built on
			top of a SPARQL Protocol Service [[sparql11-protocol]]. The SPARQL
			1.1 Secure Event (SE) Protocol [[sparql-11-se-protocol]] and the
			SPARQL Subscription Language [[sparql-11-subscription]] are out of
			the scope of this document.

		<h2>The SEPA subscription mechanism</h2>
		<p>
			The SEPA Engine implements a <b>content based publish-subscribe</b>
			mechanism where the content of events is expressed using the SPARQL
			1.1 Query Language [[sparql11-query]]. A SPARQL subscription acts as
			a persistent query: on every SPARQL update [[sparql11-update]], the
			query is evaluated and the results returned. Instead of returning all
			the results, a SEPA Engine MUST return only changes in the results
			(i.e., <i>added and removed bindings results</i>). This allows to
			save network traffic (e.g., a relevant aspect in low rates network
			typical of Web of Things systems) and at the same time it reduces the
			processing cost on the client side (i.e., no need to compare previous
			results with the current ones to understand what changed).
		<p>Considering the previous results as the query results before
			the update and the current results as the query results after the
			update, the content of a notification includes the added and removed
			results as shown in the following figure:</p>
		</p>

		<img src="addedremoved.jpg"
			title="The content of notifications: added and removed results"><br>
		<p>Fig. 2 - The content of notifications: added and removed
			results</p>

		<p>The publish-subscribe mechanism implemented by a SEPA Engine
			acts as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On receiving a subscribe request:
				<ol>
					<li>It registers the subscription and returns to the
						subscriber the subscription URI (named SPUID, Subscription
						Processing Unit ID)</li>
					<li>It performs the SPARQL 1.1 Query [[sparql11-query]]
						specified in the subscription request and notifies the subscriber
						of the results (if any)</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>On receiving an update request:
				<ol>
					<li>It checks all the active subscriptions for results to be
						notified (added, removed or both)</li>
					<li>It sends notifications (if any) to the subscribers</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
